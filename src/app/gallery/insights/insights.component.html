          Visual art is core to who I am, and you’ll almost always find a me
          accompanied by a sketchpad of sorts which I’ll use to scribble on during
          downtime. I’m also the type of person who rarely leaves the house
          without a camera, because sometimes the best photographs are the more
          spontaneous ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          The visual art I display on my site generally tends to be hobby work
          as opposed to anything professional, however at work I am tasked with
          bringing the best of these talents and skills into my day-to-day job.

    <h2>Manifesto</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>
          There are four main goals I try to adhere to when I have my artist’s hat on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Venture into the unknown.</strong>
            Never be afraid to experiment. Push the bounds of every toolset.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Challenge myself.</strong>
            Iteratively improve upon previous works by learning new techniques.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Contribute back.</strong>
            Create art not only for myself, but for the community as well.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Learn from others.</strong>
            Critique and provide constructive criticism that promotes growth.
          </li>

    <h2>On vector graphics</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>
          I create the bulk of my vector graphics using Inkscape. While I’ve
          used other vector editors in the past, I find myself returning to
          Inkscape, as it is the tool I have the most experience with.
        </p>
        <p>
          My vector graphics can go from ultra-realistic to completely whimsical
          and absurd. For my personal images, the end result is usually
          dependent upon mood and the type of piece I’m creating: I’ve been
          known to create simplistic cartoons for months on end before switching
          to the opposite end of the spectrum and creating photorealistic still
          life images.
        </p>
        <p>
          My professional vector works tend to primarily focus on visual design
          and UX wireframing, using tools such as Sketch and Balsamiq Mockups. I
          always make an effort to inject a bit of my personality into
          everything I create.

    <h2>On photography</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-8">
        <p>
          A lot of my photography is the correct mix of luck, lighting and
          determination. While I have a decent camera with a pretty bulky set of
          interchangeable lenses, I’ve always maintained that a good photographer
          can make any camera take an interesting photo.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I started off working with photos, I worked with film. Obviously,
          this meant that I could only take a set number of photos before I had
          to pay for a new reel of film, but this has served as a great lesson
          on being efficient with photos I take.
